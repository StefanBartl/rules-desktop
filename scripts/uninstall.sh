#
# It asks the installed program to take its place in the system away (`rules-hub uninstall`:
# stop the hub, the login entry, the launcher), then removes the program file from the install
# folder ($RULES_DESKTOP_INSTALL_DIR, else ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/rules-desktop/bin).
# Your settings stay unless you ask: --purge-settings removes the files of the app in the
# settings folder. The vault and your rule sets are never touched. A second run finds nothing to do
# and says so; it is not an error.
#
# If taking the system entries away fails, the program is NOT removed (a login entry that points
# at a missing program is worse than a program that is still there): read the message and run it
# again.
