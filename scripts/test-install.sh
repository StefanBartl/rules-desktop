#   scripts/test-install.sh PATH/TO/rules-hub [RELEASE_KIT_DIR]
#
# The install.sh of a release is the one of appkit's release-kit, stamped for this app; here it is
# called with what the stamp holds (--kind hub --program rules-hub). RELEASE_KIT_DIR defaults to the
# release-kit of the appkit that Cargo.lock pins (tools/release-kit-dir.py), so the test and the
# release use the same file.
#
# Everything happens in a temporary folder: the install folder, the settings folder and HOME
# are set there, the login entry and the link of this machine are left alone
# (RULES_DESKTOP_NO_LOGIN_SYNC), and nothing is downloaded (--archive). Exit 0 when all pass.
