"""Fail when a locked crate version is younger than N days.

A freshly published version is the window in which a hijacked crate does
its harm (concept risk T7: a bad release was online for 86 minutes). Cargo
has no "minimum release age" setting, so this reads Cargo.lock and asks
crates.io when each registry version was published.

    python tools/check-lock-age.py [--min-days 7] [--lock Cargo.lock]

Exit 0: every version is old enough. Exit 1: the young ones are listed;
take an older version with `cargo update -p <crate> --precise <version>`.
Exit 2: the check itself could not run (network, API); that is not a pass.

crates.io asks for one request per second and an identifying User-Agent.
